Ontime
---
Ont (short for ontime) is a cronjob-like command line tool featuring simpler commands and more robust job management. With ont, you can store jobs in a database, stop them, and restart them at any time.

This project is a work in progress, and using it in production environments is not recommended at the moment. However, we would appreciate it if you could test it and provide feedback.

## How is it different from cronjob and systemd timers?
- Easier syntax. You can submit a job with only one command.
